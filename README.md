# Smishing Detection Model Using MultinomialNB
> *Note: I did not include the model/pickle in the `.gitignore` so that the Streamlit demo will work.*
This model is for detection of smishing messages. You can use the [demo](https://smishing-detector-using-multinomial-nb-demo.streamlit.app/) to have some glimpse on how the model works.
